    <h3>Text Based Choose Your Own Adventure Game Engine</h3>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;In 2019, I began my exploration of file IO with the development of a Text Based Choose Your Own Adventure
        Game Engine. In order to make writing stories as simple as possible, each part of the story was stored in a file which
        the game engine would parse and display to the user. The file would also include what options the user had and what
        files to open next when an option was selected. However, I wanted every part of the user interface to be customizable so
        I added special variables that could be set within a file to update attributes like the background color, button color,
        text color, and text speed. I also added special syntax so that custom variables can be made and set to arbitrary values
        that can later be displayed as part of the UI. Although there are much better text based game engines out there, this
        project ultimately taught me a lot about file IO and makes for a one of a kind storytelling experience.
